# IANN
It is a function visualization package for Interpretable Architecture Neural Network (IANN) 

It has two specific structure, each of which can be efficiently represented by IANN, OVH and DASH.   

**Original Variable Hierarchical (OVH):** visualize the effects of the original variables

**Disjoint Active Subspace Hierarchical (DASH):** construct several disjoint groups first and visualize the effects of those groups instead.  

**Pros:** Less visualization plots

**Cons:** Interpreting the effects of the original variables has to go through each group
