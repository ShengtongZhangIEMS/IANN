# IANN
This is a black-box function visualization package for Interpretable Architecture Neural Network (IANN) 

It has two specific structure, each of which can be efficiently represented by IANN, OVH and DASH.   

**Original Variable Hierarchical (OVH):** visualize the effects of the original variables

**Disjoint Active Subspace Hierarchical (DASH):** construct groups of disjoint linear combinations of the inputs and visualize the effects on $f$ with the groups as the inputs.
