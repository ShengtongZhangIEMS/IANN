# IANN
It is a function visualization package for Interpretable Architecture Neural Network (IANN)

It has two specific structure, each of which can be efficiently represented by IANN:

Original Variable Hierarchical (OVH): visualize the effects of the original variables

Disjoint Active Subspace Hierarchical (DASH): construct several disjoint groups first and visualize the effects of those groups instead.
\textbf{Pros:} Less visualization plots
\textbf{Cons:} Interpreting the effects of the original variables has to go through each group  

Additive pre-process:
